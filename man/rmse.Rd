\title{Compute RMSE between one reference and one or many comparison p-curves}
\usage{
rmse(reference, comparison, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference}{Numeric vector.}

\item{comparison}{Numeric vector of same length as \code{reference}, or a
numeric matrix with \code{ncol(comparison) == length(reference)} where
each row is compared to \code{reference}.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, ignore NA values in the computation.}
}
\value{
If \code{comparison} is a vector, a single numeric value.
If \code{comparison} is a matrix, a numeric vector of length
\code{nrow(comparison)} (row names preserved if present).
}
\description{
Calculates the root mean squared error between a single
reference vector and either a single comparison vector or a matrix of
comparisons (each row is a comparison).
