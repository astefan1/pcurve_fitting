\title{Compute RMSE between one observed and one or many expected p-curves}
\usage{
rmse(observed, expected, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Numeric vector.}

\item{expected}{Numeric vector of same length as \code{observed}, or a
numeric matrix with \code{ncol(expected) == length(observed)} where
each row is compared to \code{observed}.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, ignore NA values in the computation.}
}
\value{
If \code{expected} is a vector, a single numeric value.
If \code{expected} is a matrix, a numeric vector of length
\code{nrow(expected)} (row names preserved if present).
}
\description{
Calculates the root mean squared error between a single
vector of probabilities (empirical distribution, observed values) and either a single expected vector or a matrix of
expected probabilities (each row is an expected probability; theoretical/simulated distribution).
