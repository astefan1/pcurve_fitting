\title{Compute Chi2 goodness of fit statistic between one observed p-curve and
one or many expected p-curves.}
\usage{
chi2(observed, expected, n, tol = 1e-10)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Numeric vector of probabilities (must sum to 1 within tolerance).}

\item{expected}{Numeric vector of probabilities (length = length(observed)),
or a numeric matrix with \code{ncol(expected) == length(observed)} and
each row summing to 1 within tolerance. If expected contains zeros, then these will be replaced by an arbitrary small number (tol).}

\item{n}{Positive scalar total sample size used to scale the statistic.}

\item{tol}{Numeric tolerance for probability sum checks (default 1e-10).}
}
\value{
If \code{expected} is a vector, a single numeric value.
If \code{expected} is a matrix, a numeric vector of length \code{nrow(expected)}
(names taken from \code{rownames(expected)} if present).
}
\description{
Calculates the Chi-squared statistic between a single observed
vector of probabilities (empirical distribution, observed values) and either a single expected vector or a matrix of
expected probabilities (each row is an expected probability; theoretical/simulated distribution).
