\title{Compute Chi2 goodness of fit statistic between one reference p-curve and
one or many comparison p-curves.}
\usage{
chi2(reference, comparison, n, tol = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference}{Numeric vector of probabilities (must sum to 1 within tolerance).}

\item{comparison}{Numeric vector of probabilities (length = length(reference)),
or a numeric matrix with \code{ncol(comparison) == length(reference)} and
each row summing to 1 within tolerance.}

\item{n}{Positive scalar total sample size used to scale the statistic.}

\item{tol}{Numeric tolerance for probability sum checks (default 1e-6).}
}
\value{
If \code{comparison} is a vector, a single numeric value.
If \code{comparison} is a matrix, a numeric vector of length \code{nrow(comparison)}
(names taken from \code{rownames(comparison)} if present).
}
\description{
Calculates the Chi-squared statistic between a single reference
vector of probabilities and either a single comparison vector or a matrix of
comparisons (each row is a comparison).
}
