This repository will feature the code to fit a p-curve to the results of Clarke et al. (2025)

Here is the link to the Google doc that we'll use for keeping track of the project organization: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clkeVn67dqRXtTqbZvx74JBFI9EQF0QWn0f4JlxoaLc/edit?usp=sharing

Note: The **p-value selection strategies** are: 
1: smallest, 2: smallest significant, 3: first significant
